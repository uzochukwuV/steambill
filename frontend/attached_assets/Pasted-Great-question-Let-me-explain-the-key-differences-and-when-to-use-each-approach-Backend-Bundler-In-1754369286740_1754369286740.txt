Great question! Let me explain the key differences and when to use each approach:
Backend Bundler/Intent-Based Method
Use this when:

Gasless User Experience - Users don't need ETH for gas, your backend pays
Complex Multi-Step Operations - Bundling multiple actions (approve + purchase + NFT transfer)
Cross-Chain Transactions - Your backend can coordinate actions across different chains
MEV Protection - Backend can use private mempools to prevent front-running
Failed Transaction Recovery - Backend can retry with different gas prices or handle edge cases
User Intent Optimization - Backend can find best prices, routes, or timing
Batch Operations - Processing multiple purchases or actions in one transaction

Example flow:
javascript// User signs intent (no gas needed)
const intent = await helper.createPaymentIntent({
  recipient: marketplace.address,
  amount: totalPrice,
  protocolFee: calculatedFee
});

// Send to your backend
fetch('/api/process-intent', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    intent,
    action: 'purchase',
    listingId,
    quantity
  })
});

// Backend bundles: approval + payment + NFT transfer
Direct Smart Contract Method
Use this when:

Full Decentralization - No backend dependency, pure P2P
Simple Single Actions - Direct buy/sell without complex logic
User Has ETH for Gas - Traditional Web3 users comfortable paying gas
Immediate Execution - User wants control over transaction timing
Transparent On-Chain Activity - Everything visible in user's wallet
Lower Infrastructure Costs - No backend servers to maintain

Example flow:
javascript// Traditional approach - user pays gas for each step
await helper.approveUSDC(totalCost);
await helper.purchaseWithPreApproval(listingId, quantity, paymentIntent);
Recommended Strategy
Hybrid Approach:

Default to Backend/Intent for better UX (gasless, batched)
Fallback to Direct Contract if backend is down or user prefers
Let users choose their preferred method

javascript// In your React component
const [useBackend, setUseBackend] = useState(true);

const handlePurchase = async () => {
  if (useBackend) {
    // Intent-based approach
    const intent = await createPurchaseIntent();
    await sendToBackend(intent);
  } else {
    // Direct contract approach  
    await helper.completePurchaseWithPreApproval(listingId, quantity);
  }
};
The backend bundler approach is particularly powerful for your marketplace because it can handle the entire purchase flow (payment + NFT transfer + fee distribution) in a single transaction, providing a much smoother user experience while reducing gas costs and failure points.
